James Knight, A Udacity Student!

IP Address: 34.219.161.26
SSH Port: 2200
Password: udacity


Installed software: libapache2-mod-wsgi python-dev, Postgresql, Python 2.7.12, pip, sqlalchemy, requests,flask, oauth2client,
and virtualenv.

Configuration changes: The default SSH port is 2200, and within /etc/apache2/sites-available I added FlaskApp.conf,
a configuration file that allows me to create and configure a virtual host. It sets the server's name to the IP Address
shown above, which is easily accessible by entering it into the search bar preceded by an "http://". 

I made use of Udacity's Student Hub, and got some valuable information from digitalocean (https://www.digitalocean.com
/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-flask-application-on-an-ubuntu-vps) while making this project! I also used google
plus verification for the web app itself. (Even if logging into it doesn't work) Also, can't give enought credit to (https://github.com/jungleBadger/-nanodegree-linux-server)!
